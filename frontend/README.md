# no1s1 Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for the no1s1 prototype, which allows users to interact with the no1s1 smart contracts. The version published here works with the V1 Smart Contracts. It is deployed at [no1s1.space](https://no1s1.space), but the prototype is currently not operational.

## no1s1 Frontend V1

The [no1s1_V1](./no1s1_V1) frontend code provides the functionality of the initial prototype version. It works with the [no1s1App_V1.sol](../contracts/contracts/no1s1App_V1.sol) and [no1s1Data_V1.sol](../contracts/contracts/no1s1Data_V1.sol) contracts.

<!-- ## no1s1 Frontend V2

[no1s1_V2](./no1s1_V2) contains the latest version of the no1s1 frontend. Work in progress. -->
