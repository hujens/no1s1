# no1s1 Raspberry Pi Code

This repository contains the Raspberry Pi scripts for the no1s1 prototype to control the electronics of the prototype in accordance with the smart contract code. There are different versions of the scripts that match the respective smart contracts used.

## no1s1 RPI V1

The [rpi_V1](./rpi_V1) scripts provide the functionality of the initial protoype version. They work with the [no1s1App_V1.sol](../contracts/contracts/no1s1App_V1.sol) and [no1s1Data_V1.sol](../contracts/contracts/no1s1Data_V1.sol) contracts.

## no1s1 RPI WEF

For exhibition at the World Economic Forum 2022, we used a prototype version with reduced functionality for simplified demonstration: [rpi_WEF](./rpi_WEF). These scripts are built to work with the [no1s1WEF.sol](../contracts/contracts/no1s1WEF.sol) smart contract.

## no1s1 RPI V2

[rpi_V2](./rpi_V2) contains the newest version of the no1s1 scripts. Work in progress.
