# no1s1 Raspberry Pi Code

This repository contains the Raspberry Pi scripts for the no1s1 prototype controlling the electronics of the prototype in line with the smart contract code. There are different versions of the scripts, depending on the smart contracts used.

## no1s1 RPI V1

The [rpi_V1](./rpi_V1) scripts provide the functionality of the initial version of the prototype. They work with the [no1s1App_V1.sol](../contracts/contracts/no1s1App_V1.sol) and [no1s1Data_V1.sol](../contracts/contracts/no1s1Data_V1.sol) contracts.

## no1s1 RPI WEF

For the exhibition at the World Economic Forum 2022, we used a prototype version with reduced functionality for a simplified demonstration: [rpi_WEF](./rpi_WEF). These scripts are designed to work with the smart contract [no1s1WEF.sol](../contracts/contracts/no1s1WEF.sol).

<!-- ## no1s1 RPI V2

[rpi_V2](./rpi_V2) contains the latest version of the no1s1 scripts. Work in progress. -->
